This game was made in <4 months using Unity, and a pretty solid first attempt at Agile development.

Set in a post-apocalyptic Canada, the plague that ruined the world suffers in the cold winters of Canada. Life has a chance here and as such the player must attempt to resurrect various Canadian cities, building a new world from the shell of the old one.
